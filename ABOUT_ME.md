# About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer always learning and occasionally thinking if farming would be a better option or not.

I like making Good UIs, building cool features, and exploring new tech. Currently, I'm working at a product-based AI startup remotely.

Outside work, I binge-watch anime, movies, or shows and love playing cricket or Clash Royale. I am also a very good chess player if you don't look at my rating.

I’m always up for a chat about tech, freelance, or just to connect. Feel free to reach out! Contact details available in the navbar always shown below.
