# AI Usage Disclosure

In accordance with the AI Use Policy, I used AI to help build this project faster. I worked as the **Software Architect and Developer**, using AI mainly to help write TypeScript code and implement some features.

**My Contribution (Human-Led):**
*   **UI/UX Design:** I designed and built most of the UI myself to make it look premium and high-contrast. I only used AI for a few tricky parts, but I controlled exactly how everything looks.
*   **Project Architecture:** I decided how to organize the code (like the SplitView and recursive FileExplorer), how to handle the app's state, and how it should look on different screen sizes.
*   **Feature Conception:** The cool features were my ideas: the theme switcher, the way the chat shows "Reasoning" vs "Content", and the mobile drawer.
*   **Review & Quality Control:** I checked all the code the AI wrote. I made sure it was good quality and fixed things like the layout on medium screens myself.
*   **Assets:** I added the Southbridge logo as the site icon to match the brand.

**AI Contribution (Tool-Assisted):**
*   **TypeScript Implementation:** I used AI to write the long TypeScript definitions and basic component code so I could work faster.
*   **Functionality:** I used AI to help with the hard logic, like the **complex interactive state** for the file tree and the chat simulation. This let me focus on the design and how the app feels.

**Tools Used:** Google DeepMind's Advanced Agentic Coding Assistant ( AntiGravity and Gemini 3 Pro)
